# Unit 1

## What This Does
This project runs **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) on your local machine which retrives a limited bank of information we provided to answer questions about a certain corpus or topic. 

I will be using the `city_guides` corpus. It has a collection of information about locations in the city to eat, the environment, seasons, and the nearby towns. The city_guides files are longer than the other corpus's and have many headers which will change how the RAG processes information

The questions my corpus system could answer would: be what is the easiest town to walk in, which places has transportation, and what are some warnings about navigating the city?

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:**700

**Overlap:**100

This is the perfect size for matching the document sections. This eliminates trailing chunks and mid-sentence fragments where chunks are too small or some chunks are too big. 

Every section in the document has around 200 to 700 characters and document headings usually tend to be around 50 characters

We want the chunk to encompass the entire section and the headers. 

`guide_accessibility.md` has 698 characters in one section.

`guide_eating.md` has 653 characters in one section.

Documents are around 2k characters on average so these numbers ensure that every section is included. If there were bigger sections or smaller sections the results for chunks will change so this only works for this specific corpus.

> Note: My implementation in `split_documents` doesn't use chunk_size or chunk_overlap. Each chunk is currently header separated without using the variables. I will add chunk_size and chunk_overlap once I have more time.

> Sidenote: `structure_chunk` has also has a sentence by sentence chunking strategy that uses chunk_size but doesn't use chunk_overlay. It is Gemini's solution so I only used it for testing.

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `guide_accessibility.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
# Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `guide_corry_vale.md#6` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
 When to go

May to September. Outside those months the pub in the third village closes, the farm shop reduces its hours, and several footpaths become genuinely boggy rather than merely wet. The road is not gritted above the second village and is impassable in snow.

```

**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#3` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
 Eat and drink

A tearoom attached to the mill, open 10 to 4 daily except Tuesdays, which sells bread made from the flour ground twenty metres away and is the reason most people come. One pub, food served lunchtimes and Thursday to Saturday evenings.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `guide_kestrelford.md#6` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
 When to go

Late spring and early autumn. The Saturday market runs year-round but is much reduced from November to February. August is busy with walkers. The single-track approach road is genuinely difficult in snow and the town can be cut off for a day or two most winters.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `guide_regional_transport.md#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
 The railway

The line runs along the river valley, connecting Brightwater to the regional
hub in 50 minutes. Eleven services a day on weekdays, six on Sundays. The line
north of Brightwater closed in 1963 and everything beyond it is bus or car.

Tickets are cheaper booked the day before than on the day, and considerably
cheaper than that booked a week ahead. There is no ticket office at
Brightwater station outside weekday mornings; the machine on the platform takes
cards only.
```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**
What town is the easiest to walk in for those who require accessibility?"

**Answer:**

```
According to the unofficial guide brightwater town is walkable end to end in about 35 minutes with two local bus routes at 30 min headway intervals until 7pm which stops on Sundays. Taxis exist but must be phoned; they do not circulate looking for fares. This is the easiest place to walk around compared to the information from other towns.

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.5



<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| What town is the easiest to walk in for those who require accessibility? | Yes | 0.498 |
| What is Elder Ness? | Yes | 0.188 |
| Which towns have a hospital and what times are they open? | Yes | 0.490 |
| If any, where are the grocery stores? | Yes | 0.6 |
| Where does the name of the town Elder ness originate from? | No | 0.193 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.**I used AI to analyze my solutions. It revealed keywords in my test questions like `Elder Ness` trigger the system to think it has an answer which wastes token calls on **false positives**.. I learned I could write my test questions better, but also that I can try to prevent edge cases of keywords that may trigger wasted API calls.


**2.**I used AI to help me understand how to write an acceptance criteria for the code. I was stuck for many hours and asked it to explain chunk_size and chunk_overlay. It told me its so weak it passed by accident. I changed the rule to require 100% of top retrieved chunks to end on clean sentence or header boundaries

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before
When I ask a question that is relevant to more than one corpus the retrieved chunks of the system should be able to answer 4 out of 5 of my test questions.
<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
